# Wow Open Box online HELP

## Basic information
![Window Layout](sshotWindowLayout.png)

1. Use the "Window Layout" UI to setup your Windows automatically. And you can tweak the intelligent auto layouts by:
    + Dragging any window to reposition it
    + Resize it by dragging the orange bottom right corner
    + Toggle "Stay on top" by clicking on the text
    + Use the snap to grid feature to constraint the position
    + Use the arrow keys for precise movement by 1 pixel

1. _and/or tweak it using:_ Manual Setup (from main window):

    1. Manually select the Size you want your next window to be(*)

    1. Manually select the position you want it to be at(*)

    1. Decide if that window should stay on top of others. you can use a hotkey (default `Ctrl-Shit-T`) to toggle that setting on the fly.(*)

1. Use the Bnet launcher to start your wow windows, make them "Fullscreen (Windowed)" so they are border and titlebar less and exact dimension of the windows.

1. Press the "Capture" button or use its hotkey (default `Ctrl-Shift-C`)

1. Press a hotkey to change which window gets the keyboard input: default key are `Ctrl-F1` for Wow 1, `Ctrl-F2` for Wow 2, etc.. or rotate between windows with hotkeys to focus the next window (defaults to `Ctrl-Shift-N`) and previous window (defaults to `Ctrl-Shift-P`). Hotkeys are changeable in settings.

1. Press a hotkey to swap window 1 and window N: default `Ctrl-Shift-F2` will swap 1 and 2,  `Ctrl-Shift-F3` for swapping 1 and 3, etc... changeable in settings (note that it swaps what is currently showing in each position, so if you swap 1-2 (1,2,3->2,1,3) and then 1-3 you end up with 3 1 2). Or rotate the swap between all windows by repeatedly pressing `Ctrl-Shift-F1` for forward swap or `Ctrl-Shift-OEM3` (the ~ ` key on us keyboards) for backward swap.

*: You can change all settings at any time and they will be saved, per window index when you click "Update" or "Save and Apply" in the Window Layout GUI.

Your settings are saved in `wowopenboxSettings.tcl` in same folder as WowOpenBox and can be edited pressing the "Edit Settings" button.

You can toggle the focus follow mouse behavior using a hotkey (default `Ctrl-Shift-F`)
