# Wow Open Box (Open Source, compliant, Multiboxing)

Welcome to WowOpenBox.org the hub for truly Open Source and Blizzard rules compliant World of Warcraft MultiBoxing/Dual-Boxing!

We started this effort Mid November 2020 and already have dozens of ever improving feature-full releases and many happy users.

Join the conversation through GitHub, make or help prioritize [issues](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/issues/), PRs, or on our <a href="https://discord.gg/SMGvEeb"><img src="discord.svg" alt="discord" align="center" height="24pt"></a>

The first of many functional [release](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/releases) was on November 22nd 2020!

Participate and let's make this the best tool for multiboxing (in addition to being the only Open Source one).

See also a [comparison](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/wiki/compare) of WowOpenBox and other multiboxing solutions.

WowOpenBox (WOB) is optimized to be the safest and best solution for Blizzard's World of Warcraft but can also be use to manage multiple windows of other applications or games.

## Main features

- Window Layout wizard and manual tweaking; get your game windows exactly how you want them to be to play.
- Instant swapping of windows; with keyboard hotkeys for fast switching to the next or any specific window.
- Many additional options to switch which window your keys are going to:
  - Focus follow mouse: turns on/off the Windows&trade; accessibility feature so you just hover a window to make it receive keys
  - Focus next/previous/specific windows with hotkeys.
  - Optional Round robin: after you press configurable keys, focus switches to the next window automatically.
- Free, OpenSource and the [Safest](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/wiki/FAQ#i-heard-wob-is-safer-than-jmb-how-so) option available: WOB respects Blizzard's new directive to not do any software input broadcasting. Multiboxing legitimately with peace of mind.
- Online [help](help), menus and tooltips on most UI element to help discovering features.

## Installation

WowOpenBox is optimized for Microsoft Windows 10.

Since release 2.2, WOB/OMB is entirely built automatically from source by GitHub actions CI (continuous integration).

Simply download the all in one zip (OpenMultiBoxing-vX.Y.Z.zip) from the latest release at: [https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/releases](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox/releases) and extract it all to your desktop for instance.

If you want to use the optional Round Robin feature, just launch the `OpenMultiBoxing_RR` exe and run that to get RR. If you don't want RR start `OpenMultiBoxing` (with the version) instead (if you want RR you need both binaries, the RR is just a small wrapper enabling RR in the main exe).

Run either and enjoy!

(Please report any problem!)
